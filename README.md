# Random Fact Forest

This is a random fact generator with a fun forest twist. The facts generated will be delivered via cute forest critters, but beware the evil disinformation Troll! Take the Trolls facts at your own risk. The Random fact Forest currently features two nice forest critters and one disinformation cave troll. 

Click the rock in front to see the bunny.
